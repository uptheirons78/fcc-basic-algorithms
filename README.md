Basic Algorithms Solutions from the Free Code Camp Curriculum with explanations

### Reverse a string
You need to master split(), reverse() and join() method to solve this first problem. It is very important to understand how the 3 given methods works together to reverse the string.

### Factorialize a number
I found two ways to solve this problem. So in this repository you find two diffent files each one with a solution. The first one contains the solution with "recursion", known as "the process of defining a problem in terms of a simpler version of itself". There is a very good explanation of recursion here: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/recursion.html
