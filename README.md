### Reverse a string
You need to master **split(), reverse() and join()** method to solve this first problem. It is very important to understand how the 3 given methods works together to reverse the string.

### Factorialize a number
I found two ways to solve this problem. So in this repository you find two diffent files each one with a solution. The first one contains the solution with "**recursion**", known as "the process of defining a problem in terms of a simpler version of itself". There is a very good explanation of recursion here: *https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/recursion.html* 
In the second solution I solved the problem using a **for loop, the push()** method over an empty array I created and then the powerful **reduce()** method on that array. Longer, harder, but useful to have a first glance on what **reduce()** is.
